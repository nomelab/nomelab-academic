  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Alkrothal 720 and Kanthal APMT™, two commercial FeCrAl alloys, were neutron irradiated up to damage doses of 7.0 displacements per atom (dpa) in the temperature range of 320 to 382 °C to characterize the $\alpha$′ precipitation in these alloys using small-angle neutron scattering. Both alloys exhibited $\alpha$′ precipitation. Kanthal APMT™ exhibited higher number densities and volume fraction, a result attributed to its higher Cr content compared with Alkrothal 720. Trends observed as a function of damage dose (dpa) are consistent with literature trends for both FeCr and FeCrAl alloys.},
