  abstract = {A ferritic/martensitic steel, HT9, was irradiated in the BOR-60 reactor to ∼17.1 and ∼35.1 displacements per atom (dpa) at 650 ± 23 K (377 ± 23 °C). Irradiated samples were comprehensively characterized using analytical scanning/transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography, with emphasis on the role of irradiation dose on the microstructure evolution. Radiation-induced Mn/Ni/Si-rich (G-phase) and radiation-enhanced Cr-rich ($\alpha$ʹ) precipitates were observed within the martensitic laths at all doses. In addition, the G-phase was also observed to precipitate heterogeneously at various defect sinks. The number density for these second-phase precipitates decreases while the size increases with increasing dose, resulting in an increase of the volume fraction. Both a {\textless}100{\textgreater} and a/2 {\textless}111{\textgreater} type loops were observed with the a {\textless}100{\textgreater} type being the predominant type at both doses. The proportion of a {\textless}100{\textgreater} loops is consistent with that previously observed in HT9 ion irradiated to similar doses at ∼693–743 K (∼420-470 °C). Only small cavities (diameter {\textless} 2 nm) were observed at ∼17.1 dpa whereas both small and large cavities were observed at ∼35.1 dpa, resulting in a bi-modal cavity size distribution at this dose. Alloying elements, Ni and Si, were observed to segregate to the cavity surface, forming Ni/Si-rich shells around the cavities. The swelling at ∼17.1 dpa is evaluated at ∼0.02{\%} while the swelling at ∼35.1 dpa is found to be ∼0.07{\%} with variations from grain to grain. attributed to the spatial variation of the density of large cavities (in different grains). The swelling data obtained in this study was compared with the neutron data of F/M steels available in the literature.},
