abstract: Videos captured using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) can
  encode details regarding the morphological and temporal evolution of a
  material by taking snapshots of the microstructure sequentially. However,
  manual analysis of such video is tedious, error-prone, unreliable, and
  prohibitively time-consuming if one wishes to analyze a significant fraction
  of frames for even videos of modest length. In this work, we developed an
  automated TEM video analysis system for microstructural features based on the
  advanced object detection model called YOLO and tested the system on an
  in-situ ion irradiation TEM video of dislocation loops formed in a FeCrAl
  alloy. The system provides analysis of features observed in TEM including both
  static and dynamic properties using the YOLO-based defect detection module
  coupled to a geometry analysis module and a dynamic tracking module. Results
  show that the system can achieve human comparable performance with an F1 score
  of 0.89 for fast, consistent, and scalable frame-level defect analysis. This
  result is obtained on a real but exceptionally clean and stable data set and
  more challenging data sets may not achieve this performance. The dynamic
  tracking also enabled evaluation of individual defect evolution like per
  defect growth rate at a fidelity never before achieved using common human
  analysis methods. Our work shows that automatically detecting and tracking
  interesting microstructures and properties contained in TEM videos is viable
  and opens new doors for evaluating materials dynamics.
