abstract = "Microstructures of T91 neutron irradiated in the BOR60 reactor at five temperatures between 376 °C and 524 °C to doses between 15.4 and 35.1 dpa were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and atom probe tomography (APT). Type a\\textless100\\textgreater dislocation loops were observed at 376–415 °C and network dislocations dominated at 460 °C and 524 °C. Cavities appeared in a bimodal distribution with a high density of small bubbles less than 2 nm at irradiation temperatures between 376 °C and 415 °C. Small bubbles were also observed at 460 °C and 524 °C but cavities greater than 2 nm were absent. Enrichment of Cr, Ni, and Si at the grain boundary was observed at all irradiation temperatures. Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) of Cr, Ni and Si appeared to saturate at 17.1 dpa and 376 °C. The temperature dependence of RIS of Cr, Ni and Si at the grain boundary, which showed a peak Cr enrichment temperature of 460 °C and a lower peak Ni and Si enrichment temperature of ∼400 °C, was consistent with observations of RIS of Cr in proton irradiated T91, suggesting that the same RIS mechanism may also apply to BOR60 irradiated T91. G-phase and Cu-rich precipitates were observed at 376–415 °C but were absent at 460 °C and 524 °C. The absence of G-phase at 524 °C could be related to the minimal segregation of Ni and Si in that condition."
