abstract = "Ferritic-martensitic (F/M) alloys are expected to play an important role as cladding or structural components in Generation IV and other advanced nuclear systems operating in the temperature range 350-700 °C and to doses up to 200 displacements per atom (dpa). Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) F/M steels have been developed to operate at higher temperatures than traditional F/M steels. These steels contain nanometer-sized Y-Ti-O nanoclusters for additional strengthening. A proton irradiation to 1 dpa at 525 °C has been performed on a 9Cr ODS steel to determine the nanocluster stability at low dose. The evolution of the nanocluster population and the composition at the nanocluster-matrix interface were studied using electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. The data from this study are contrasted to those from a previous study on heavy-ion irradiated 9Cr ODS steel. \\textcopyright 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V."
