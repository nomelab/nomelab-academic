abstract = "In early 2017, the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (FESAC), an advisory committee to the United States Department of Energy, was charged with identifying transformative enabling capabilities (TECs) “that could promote efficient advance toward fusion energy, building on burning plasma science and technology.” A subcommittee with broad expertise was formed and sought feedback from scientific experts, including experts from outside the fusion community. Three workshops were conducted, and a report was approved by FESAC in 2018 that identified four of the “most promising” TECs: advanced algorithms, high-critical-temperature superconductors, advanced materials and manufacturing, and novel technologies for tritium fuel cycle control. In addition, one “promising” TEC was identified: fast flowing liquid metal plasma-facing components. This paper will give details on the promising TECs and an overview on considerations of these TECs in the United States since the publication of the report."
