abstract = "Complex material systems in which microstructure and microchemistry are nonuniformly dispersed require three-dimensional (3D) rendering(s) to provide an accurate determination of the physio-chemical nature of the system. Current scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)-based tomography techniques enable 3D visualization but can be time-consuming, so only select systems or regions are analyzed in this manner. Here, it is presented that through high-efficiency multidimensional STEM acquisition and reconstruction, complex point cloud-like microstructural features can quickly and effectively be reconstructed in 3D. The proposed set of techniques is demonstrated, analyzed, and verified for a high-chromium steel with heterogeneously situated features induced using high-energy neutron bombardment."
