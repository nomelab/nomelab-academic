abstract = "FeCrAl alloys are promising for developing accident tolerant nuclear fuel claddings. These alloys showed good environmental compatibility and oxidation resistance in elevated-temperature water and steam, as well as low radiation-induced swelling. However, FeCrAl alloys may suffer from several degradation mechanisms, one of which may be a susceptibility to cracking during welding. Here, a set of advanced modified FeCrAl alloys were designed and produced by varying Al-content and employing additions of Nb and TiC. Strength, ductility, and deformation hardening behavior of the advanced FeCrAl alloys and their weldments are discussed."
