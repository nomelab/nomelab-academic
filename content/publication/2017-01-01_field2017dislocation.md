abstract = "FeCrAl alloys with varying compositions and microstructures are under consideration for accident-tolerant fuel cladding, but limited details exist on dislocation loop formation and growth for this class of alloys under neutron irradiation. Four model FeCrAl alloys with chromium contents ranging from 10.01 to 17.51 wt \\% and aluminum contents of 4.78 to 2.93 wt \\% were neutron irradiated to doses of 0.3–0.8 displacements per atom (dpa) at temperatures of 335–355 °C. On-zone STEM imaging revealed a mixed population of black dots and larger dislocation loops with either a/2〈111〉 or a〈100〉 Burgers vectors. Weak composition dependencies were observed and varied depending on whether the defect size, number density, or ratio of defect types was of interest. Results were found to mirror those of previous studies on FeCrAl and FeCr alloys irradiated under similar conditions, although distinct differences exist."
