The objective of this project is to enhance radiation tolerance of structural materials over a suitable service temperature range. This task could be achieved by expanding the applications of carbon/ boron nitride nanotubes to more nuclearpractical materials such as steels - as long as the carbon/ boron nitride nanotubes or similar dispersoids are stable at processing and operating temperatures. Ion irradiation, nanoindentation, and microstructure characterization will be carried out on materials with and without carbon/boron nitride nanotubes to study the effect of nanotubes on radiation damage.
