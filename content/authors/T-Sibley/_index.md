I received my BS and MS in Materials Science and Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and am currently a 4th-year PhD candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. My research interests focus on applying AI and machine learning to materials characterization and property exploration, with a strong focus on materials used in civilian nuclear energy systems. I have a passion for microscopy, microstructural evolution, and engaging with science policy.
