My name is Nicholas Clancy and I am currently an undergraduate studying nuclear engineering at the University of Michigan. This is my first introduction to research and am very excited to experience it for the first time. While I do not fully have my professional goals finalized yet, two ideas I've considered are to do research full time or to work at a nuclear power plant.
