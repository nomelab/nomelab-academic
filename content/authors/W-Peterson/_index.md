I received my Bachelors of Science in Physics at Iowa State University in 2022 and decided to pursue a graduate degree in Nuclear Engineering here at the University of Michigan. I have an interest in Materials Science and would like to study how we can advance materials to better suit nuclear environments in order to produce abundant clean energy for the world.
