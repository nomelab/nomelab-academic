Boyan Zheng is an undergraduate student in the Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences at the University of Michigan, with interests in computational modeling for fusion energy materials and plasma physics. When Boyan is not in the lab, he is serving as the 2025-2026 President of the American Nuclear Society Student Chapter at the University of Michigan (ANS U-M) whilst building M-Atomics --- the University of Michigan's first student projects team for nuclear engineering students. After his BSE, Boyan hopes to pursue a MS/PhD or work within the fusion energy industry.
