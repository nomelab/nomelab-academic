Robert (Robby) Renfrow is a graduate student at the University of Michigan in the Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences Department. Before starting his degree at UM in the Fall of 2021, he obtained his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN. While there, he gained an interest in nuclear via learning about the thorium fuel cycle in his chemistry class, which sparked his interest in the field and led him to pursue a graduate education in nuclear engineering. 

Robby's research is primarily focused on investigating radiation effects in additively manufactured alloys by simulating neutron damage with ions and S/TEM characterization. Generally, he is interested in the development and characterization of advanced materials for the use in advanced non-LWR applications. He is also an advocate for the deployment of advanced nuclear energy and was awarded a policy research fellowship via the Washington Internships for Students of Engineering (WISE) program in the summer of 2021. During the fellowship, he investigated policy issues surrounding the development of advanced modeling and simulation codes for advanced reactor licensing.
