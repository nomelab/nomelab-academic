Welcome to the Nuclear Oriented Materials & Examination (NOME) Laboratory at the <a href="http://umich.edu" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a>. Our research focuses on three broad areas: (i) <strong>advanced manufacturing and alloy development:</strong> development of novel processing routes and compositions to obtain high performance alloys for nuclear energy applications, (ii) <strong>radiation effects and characterization:</strong> examination of the materials changes induced through radiation using advanced characterization techniques, and (iii) <strong>emerging technologies:</strong> rapid exploration of disruptive technologies including data analytics for nuclear energy applications. 

We are a diverse and multidisciplinary team with backgrounds in nuclear engineering, materials science, physics, and mechanical engineering. Our laboratory leverages the vast resources at University of Michigan including the <a href="https://mibl.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Michigan Ion Beam Laboratory</a> and the <a href="https://mc2.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Michigan Center for Materials Characterization</a>. We also partner with external collaborators such as <a href="http://inl.gov" target="_blank">Idaho National Laboratory</a> and <a href="http://ornl.gov" target="_blank">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> and use scientific user facilities such as the <a href="http://nsuf.inl.gov" target="_blank">Nuclear Science User Facility</a> to accomplish our research and development goals. 

The NOME lab welcomes innovative thought and seeks to foster a culture that uses diversity and cross-cutting activities to springboard new innovations in nuclear materials.

<!---The Principle Investigator, Dr. Kevin G. Field, is an Associate Professor in the Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences Department at the University of Michigan. Prof. Field joined University of Michigan in 2019 after nearly seven years at <a href="http://ornl.gov" target="_blank">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> where his research on accident tolerant fuel forms lead to the first deployment of <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/ges-nuclear-fuel-designs-ready-reactor-testing" target="_blank">IronClad</a>, a FeCrAl alloy, as a lead test rod in the Hatch I nuclear power plant. He has received numerous national and international awards for his research. For more details, you can read a short bio or his vitae.-->
