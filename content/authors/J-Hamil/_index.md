Justin attended the University of New Mexico, double majoring in Nuclear Engineering and the Russian Language. Justin is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences at the University of Michigan. His research focuses on manufacturing techniques and radiation effects in HT-9 steel to better understand material degradation in nuclear reactors. Justinâ€™s work focuses on sample preparation with a rolling mill and furnace, ion irradiation at the Michigan Ion Beam Laboratory, and sample characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
