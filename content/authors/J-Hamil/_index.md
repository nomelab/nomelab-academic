Justin attended the University of New Mexico, double majoring in Nuclear Engineering and the Russian Language. Justin is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences at the University of Michigan. His research focuses on in-situ experiments of irradiated samples coupled with machine learning analyzation techniques. Additionally, he performs heat-to-heat swelling variability experiments of ferritic-martensitic steels with defocused dual-ion irradiations and sample characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
