I am an undergraduate studying physics at the University of Michigan. I am interested in doing research at the frontiers of nuclear physics, particular in nuclear reactions, including computational applications of the sort I work with within NOME. I hope to translate the technical skills I develop in this research to future endeavors in the field of nuclear physics.
