I got my B.S. from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I became interested in materials when researching potential materials for the type C cask for transporting plutonium for my senior design. Then, I went to the University of Tokyo and got my M.Eng. My research there mainly focuses on how nano oxide particles inside ODS steel affect cavity nucleation and growth under irradiation. 

I am very interested in the characterization of defects in materials using TEM and STEM. Also, I love doing in-situ TEM to see the whole process of defect evolution. Since characterizing defects can be very time-consuming and error-prone, I started to think about using ML to automate the analysis.
