T.M. Kelsy Green's research focuses on simulating neutron damage with ions through microstructural and mechanical investigations of irradiated ferritic/martensitic alloys. She also studies novel microstructures created through additive manufacturing and their radiation tolerance. Kelsy is an advocate for nuclear energy and received the Walter Meyer Scholarship for Nuclear Information and Energy Policy in 2018 for her contributions to public awareness and policy.
