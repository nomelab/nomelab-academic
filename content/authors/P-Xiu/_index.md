Dr. Pengyuan Xiu has been working on radiation effects on various metal-based alloy systems for nuclear reactor applications for his Ph.D. work, including additively-manufactured HT9 alloys using direct-energy-deposition, Ni-based concentrated solid solution alloys, and FeCrAl alloys by performing single/dual ion beam irradiation, EBSD + FIB + Flash-Polishing for thin foil sample preparation, and S/TEM characterization. He has strong expertise on utilizing most common JEOL and ThermoFisher S/TEMs for radiation effects characterization with various techniques, including rel-rod, on-zone STEM and two-beam conditions for dislocation loop analysis, STEM-HAADF, STEM-EDX and STEM-EELS for chemistry study, as well as HRTEM.
