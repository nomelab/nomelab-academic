Mackenzie Warwick is a graduate student in the Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences department at the University of Michigan, with a focus in developing high-temperature, low-activation superalloys for fission and fusion reactor applications. Mackenzie is also an intern at Idaho National Laboratory researching the feasibility of the isotopic-tailoring of nickel in Inconel 718 for low-activation purposes. Mackenzie is involved in ANS and is the founding President of the WIN student chapter at UM. Additionally, Mackenzie has a strong interest in Japanâ€™s nuclear energy sector: she became interested in nuclear energy after the 2011 Fukushima accident. Mackenzie has 10 years of intermediate experience with Japanese and has visited Japan twice.
