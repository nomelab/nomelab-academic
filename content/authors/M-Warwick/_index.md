Mackenzie Warwick is a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences department at the University of Michigan, with a focus on ion irradiation creep and material performance in coupled extreme environments. Mackenzie is an intern at Idaho National Laboratory researching crystal plasticity and modeling of creep mechanisms for long-term performance prediction. She has previously researched the technical and economic feasibility of isotopic-tailoring of nickel in Inconel-718 for low-activation purposes as a fusion first-wall candidate material. Mackenzie has a strong interest in Japanâ€™s nuclear energy sector as she became interested in nuclear energy after the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident. She has 12 years of intermediate experience with Japanese and has visited Japan three times. When Mackenzie is not in the lab, she is typically running K-12 outreach workshops that she has developed to increase the accessibility of nuclear engineering topics for young students.
