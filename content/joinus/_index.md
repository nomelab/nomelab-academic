We are always interested in recruiting innovative undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows with diverse backgrounds to join the NOME lab. 

## Undergraduate Research Experience

Undergraduate students can pursue research experiences in the NOME lab through the University of Michigan <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/urop/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programs</a>.

If you have any questions about the undergraduate research opportunities in our laboratory, you can
contact Prof. Field via <a href="../../#contact">email</a>.</p> 

## Joining as a Masters or PhD Student

If you are interested in pursuing your graduate studies in the NOME Lab, you can join us through the <a href="https://rackham.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Rackham Graduate School</a> through the <a href="https://ners.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/" target="_blank">Graduate Program</a> in the Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences department. Applications are due in mid-December of every year.

The Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences Graduate Program is consistently ranked as one of the top nuclear engineering programs by U.S. News and World Report. The program is diverse and broad with six faculty within the nuclear materials option.

<strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions from Prospective Graduate Students</strong></u><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> <i>Are you taking on new graduate students in the Fall?</i><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes! We typically welcome 1 graduate student in the Fall term of each year.

<strong>Q:</strong> <i>What departments do the group members come from?</i><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The majority of our PhD students come with a background in Nuclear Engineering or Materials Science \& Engineering. However, due to the interdisciplinary nature of our research, we also have graduate and undergraduate students from Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Physics, and Computer Science.

<strong>Q:</strong> <i>What projects have open positions?</i><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Please visit our <a href="../../#projects/">projects page</a> for an idea regarding current and ongoing projects within the laboratory. Incoming graduate students could be incorporated into one of these listed projects or start a new project depending on the labs current and pending support. Incoming graduate students will have a general theme (e.g. advanced manufacturing) determined prior to your first semester but specific projects will not be determined until 1-2 months before the start of the first semester.

<strong>Q:</strong> <i>How does the group work?</i><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Graduate students will meet with Prof. Field either weekly or biweekly for mentoring and research discussions. The frequency of the meeting will depend on the seniority of the student and current workload in the semester. We also hold biweekly group meetings broken into two primary components: (i) housekeeping and (ii) technical discussions/presentations. Group meetings are structured to run 1 to 1.5 hours. Special group meetings are held prior to conferences/defenses/etc. to provide detailed feedback on external presentations. Additional meetings can include break-out meetings based on project/topic. Finally, graduate students focused on radiation effects testing are required to attend the biweekly Michigan Ion Beam Laboratory (MIBL) meeting led by Prof. Was and Dr. Toader. 

<strong>Q:</strong> <i>Will I get to travel?</i><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Modern science is a highly collaborative environment and nothing beats a face-to-face discussion to get across new ideas and make breakthroughs. We expect our graduate students to travel to better their work and develop connections for their career. Senior graduate students are encouraged to present their findings at 1 or more domestic conferences per year. If the student's work supports an on-going Department of Energy program it is possible to also attend coordination meetings and other workshops throughout the course of their graduate work.

<strong>Q:</strong> <i>How long will it take to get my PhD?</i><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The PhD process is a highly individual process and the length of the process will depend on you and the project. The expectation is the first 2 years is spent taking the required coursework and developing the necessary skill sets to be an effective researcher. The last 2-3.5 years is then devoted towards completing your respective thesis. We expect students to take between 4 to 5.5 years to complete their PhD.

<strong>Q:</strong> <i>Can I contact current graduate students to get an idea about the group?</i><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes! This is highly encouraged. The two foundations to your PhD is your project and adviser. Current graduate students in NOME can provide insight into the latter. Please see our <a href="../../#people">people page</a> for contact information for current graduate students and alumni.

If you have any questions about the graduate program, current projects, or seek references for Prof. Field as a supervisor please contact Prof. Field via <a href="../../#contact">email</a>.
