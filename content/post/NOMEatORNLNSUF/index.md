---

NOME Lab group members Kelsy Green and Gabriella Bruno traveled to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to perform analytical electron microscopy on neutron irradiated HT-9 samples as part of the <a href="../../project/snap">SNAP project</a>. The work was supported by a collaborative research program and through the <a href="https://nsuf.inl.gov/">Nuclear Scientific User Facility (NSUF)</a> which provides access to research laboratories for nuclear materials-based research. ORNL's Low Activation Materials Development and Analysis (LAMDA) facility is a NSUF partner facility.
