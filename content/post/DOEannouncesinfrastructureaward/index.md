title: DOE Nuclear Energy announces award for NOME
---

<a href="../../authors/kg-field">Prof. Field</a> has received <a href="https://neup.inl.gov/Lists/Headlines/AnnouncementDispForm.aspx?ID=213">announcement</a> of the award of his Nuclear Energy University Program proposal titled, "Development of a High Throughput Nuclear Materials Synthesis Laboratory." The project will allow for the acquisition of equipment to establish rapid materials consolidation and modification to complement the already established facilities at the University of Michigan, including the world-class Michigan Ion Beam Laboratory (MIBL). Coupling both MIBL and the proposed facility in a single research effort will result in a new end-to-end high throughput nuclear materials discovery capability in a single institution. The resulting increase in capability will serve all nuclear energy supporting universities, national laboratories, and industry.
