title: NOME welcomes Dr. Patki and M. Warwick
---

NOME welcomes two new faces, Ms.  <a href="../../authors/m-warwick">Mackenzie Warwick</a> and Dr. Priyam Patki, to the group! Mackenzie joins NOME as a graduate student with a BSE in Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences from the University of Michigan. Her work focuses on developing high-temperature, low-activation superalloys for fission and fusion application with collaborations at <a href="https://inl.gov/">Idaho National Laboratory</a>. Priyam joins NOME as a postdoctoral fellow after receiving his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from Purdue University. Dr. Patki was advised by <a href="https://wharryresearchgroup.wordpress.com/">Janelle Wharry</a> at Purdue where his research focused on using TEM in situ pico-indentation to probe and alter the microstructure of irradiated alloys. 

Welcome to both!
