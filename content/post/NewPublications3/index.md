Prof. Field co-authored two new papers this Fall: 

A <a href="../../publication/2020-01-01_zhong2020microstructures">paper </a> highlight the ability for machine learning to perform automated detection and tracking in in situ TEM videos. The paper is tied to our  <a href="../../project/mldetect/">project</a> on exploring convolutional neural networks for defect detection.  

A <a href="../../publication/2020-01-01_song2020microstructural">paper</a>  on the effect of chromium and aluminum on the radiation response of wrought FeCrAl alloys.
