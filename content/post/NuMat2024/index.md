We are excited to announce that Prof. Kevin Field and Lauryn Kortman recently traveled to Singapore to attend and present at the prestigious NuMat 2024 nuclear materials conference. Prof. Field delivered a talk titled, "Identifying Human and Image Quality Biases in Radiation Swelling Studies with TEM," which is based on recent work by NOME group member, G. Bruno, on addressing critical aspects of bias in quantification of microscopy images. Meanwhile, Lauryn Kortman captivated the audience with her flashtalk and poster presentation, "Quantifying Stored Energy Release in Irradiated YBCO through Molecular Dynamics Annealing Simulations" based on her undergraduate research while at MIT.
