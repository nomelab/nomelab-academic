Prof. Field and University of Michigan collaborator Dr. Miao Song traveled to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to peform analytical electron microscopy on neutron irradiated austenitic stainless steel samples from a commericial nuclear reactor as part of the <a href="../../project/rapidsim">Rapid Simulation of Irradaition Damage in PWR Internals</a> project. The work was supported by a collaborative research program and through the <a href="https://nsuf.inl.gov/">Nuclear Scientific User Facility (NSUF)</a> which provides access to research laboratories for nuclear materials-based research. ORNL's Low Activation Materials Development and Analysis (LAMDA) facility is a NSUF partner facility.
