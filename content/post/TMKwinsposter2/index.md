The U.S. Clean Energy Education and Empowerment (C3E) initiative presented NOME lab graduate student, <a href="../../authors/tmk-green">Kelsy Green</a>, with the Best Poster Award as part of their annual U.S. C3E Symposium. The poster, titled "Radiation Tolerant Materials for Advanced Nuclear Reactors", discusses her on-going research into the use of advanced manufacturing techniques to tailor the microstructures of advanced steels for high dose applications in nuclear power plants. Kelsy's work is tied to NOME's ongoing <a href="../../project/eca/">project</a> on precipitate stability in advanced steels.  

The U.S. C3E Poster Competition is an avenue used by C3E to have students and early-career researchers present their innovative works and compete for awards as the annual symposium. The poster awards are selected by a committee with wide-ranging expertise. More details can be found <a href="https://www.c3eawards.org/posters">here</a>.
