The Nuclear Oriented Materials and Examination (NOME) lab is thrilled to welcome Lauryn Kortman, a first-year PhD student in the Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences at the University of Michigan. Lauryn's research will focus on irradiation effects in materials for fusion reactors, significantly contributing to the ongoing projects within the NOME group.

Lauryn completed her B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2024. During her time at MIT, she conducted research on the irradiation of YBCO, a high-temperature superconductor, and developed a novel method for hydrogen mapping using Palladium. She gained valuable industry experience through internships at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA) and Marvel Fusion (Munich, Germany) during the summers of 2022 and 2023.

With expertise in radiation effects, fusion energy, advanced nuclear materials, simulation, and characterization, Lauryn aims to advance the understanding and development of materials crucial for the future of fusion energy. After completing her PhD, she aspires to work in the fusion industry and contribute to identifying the best materials for the next generation of fusion reactors.

Please join us in welcoming Lauryn to the team. We look forward to the innovative contributions she will bring to our research initiatives.
