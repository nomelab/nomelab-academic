title: New GPU cluster installed and operational
---

Today we installed our new <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/gpu-workstations/vector">Lambda Vector GPU workstation</a> in our NOME offices. This system uses four Nvidia RTX <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a5000/">A5000 GPUs</a> with NVLink to perform our machine learning training and testing tasks as part of our deep learning detection <a href="../../project/mldetect/">project</a>. The system will greatly increase our throughput and enable the development of more sophisticated models and research based activities. Our current benchmarks show the system to be six times faster than Google Colab!
