Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL) Science and Technology Deputy Director, Michelle Buchanan, presented NOME Lab graduate student, Kelsy Green, with the Best Poster Award-Industry Choice at the 7th Annual Oak Ridge Postgraduate Research Symposium. Kelsy's poster, titled "Optimizing Additive Manufacturing for Advanced Nuclear Reactors", showed that modifying the cover gas used in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) can help increase the phase fraction of favorable MX precipitates over traditional manufacturing processes in the Grade 91 alloy. Her work involved completing systematic analysis of the microstructure and mechanical properties of the WAAM specimens using advanced characterization and uni-axial tensile tests.
