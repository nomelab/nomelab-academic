title: G. Bruno completes her first irradiation in MIBL
---

Congrats to Gabriella Bruno for completing her first irradiation in the <a href="https://mibl.engin.umich.edu/">Michigan Ion Beam Laboratory</a> as part of her work within the <a href="../../#projects">SNAP project</a>! The irradiation was a dual beam irradiation completed to 70.1 dpa with 4.23 appm He/dpa. The irradiation was completed to mimic the high dose irradiations completed on HT-9 within the BOR-60 materials test reactor in Russia.
