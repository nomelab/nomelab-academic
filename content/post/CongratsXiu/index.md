Congratulations to Pengyuan Xiu for completing his prospectus exam titled, "Dislocation loop and microchemical evolution in ion irradiated structural materials for advanced reactor applications." This work examined the microstructural and microchemical evolution in Ni-based, FeCrAl, and additive manufactured alloys and highlighted Pengyuan's expertise in microscopy and characterization. The exam was chaired by <a href="../../authors/kg-field">Prof. Field</a> and Prof. Wang with the inclusion of Prof. Misra, Prof. Gao, and Prof. Allen serving as committee members and Prof. Kiedrowski as the NERS representative. The next stop for Pengyuan is his thesis defense planned for Winter 2021. Great work Pengyuan!
