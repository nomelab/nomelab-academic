title: DOE ARPA-E announces GAMOW award for NOME
---

<a href="../../authors/kg-field">Prof. Field</a> has been been awarded funding for research as part of a joint proposal with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to the <a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/programs/gamow">GAMOW program</a> within the U.S. Department of ARPA-E program. The research entitled, "Advanced Castable Nanostructured Alloys for First-wall/Blanket Applications" will focus on bringing the tailored microstructures of castable nanostructured alloys to commercial market for the fusion reactor community. NOME will focus on the performing the irradiation testing using the <a href="https://mibl.engin.umich.edu/">Michigan Ion Beam Laboratory</a> to confirm preliminary performance of the ORNL developed alloys in fusion relevant radiation environment over the course of the 3 year program.
